# Nefes21CardSystem

This is a self-updating card selection and interpretation system for the nefes21 platform. The project empowers administrators to add new decks, card messages, and interpretations easily via a simple, compact admin panel. Its modern design is built on the successful, fast, and harmonious communication between HTML, PHP, and CSS. The development process was assisted by artificial intelligence. The code comments clarify the purpose of each class, allowing for easy updates and modifications. Happy coding!

Featuring a sophisticated and seamless design, the project allows users to access any message from anywhere through its 3D-scrolling card interface. Its most significant characteristic is the user-friendliness of the entire system; the admin panel, the main index.php, and the comment sections are all built to be intuitive and easy for anyone to use.
